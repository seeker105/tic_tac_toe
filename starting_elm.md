#### Install
Install the Elm Platform by downloading and running the Elm installer for your favorite operating system.

Once you've installed the Elm Platform, you should be able to run the following command:

elm make --version
The code included in this tutorial is based on Elm Platform 0.16, so make sure that version is displayed in the output.

You'll also need to install the Node.js JavaScript environment as the Elm REPL relies on it to run JavaScript code outside the browser. Pre-built installers are available for Mac and Windows. Alternatively, if you're using the Homebrew package manager on a Mac, you can install Node.js using brew install node.

Once installed, you should be able the run the following commands and see version numbers:

node --version
npm --version
For reference during the course, go ahead and bookmark the documentation pages for the Elm Core Libraries and the elm-html package.

Finally, we also recommend installing an Elm syntax highlighting plugin or mode for your favorite text editor.
